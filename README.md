Test-Repository
===============

Just a test.
No really. This is just a test.
No one should really give me access to Github anymore but...you know...I have my ways.

This is kinda fancy actually. Makes a great text editor.

Am I allowed to write all my proposal in Github and commit them to a client repo? That would be cool.
